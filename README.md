SVN
=============

## Purpose

This site was built for fun and emulated the 37signals blog, Signals vs. Noise. I loved the design and functionality of the original, and wanted to see if I could build it from scratch. Please visit the site at:

## How it was built

Jekyll, a static-site generator built in Ruby, was used to create the functionality of the blog. The HTML, CSS and Javascript were written starting from my personal framework: 

https://github.com/paulh16/pgh_framework

Other tools used to build the site are:

* SASS
* Grunt
* Modernizr
* Adobe Typekit Fonts

The site is responsive, starting from a mobile layout. The layout adjusts several times as the screen widens until it reaches the desktop version. The site is deployed on Github Pages.
